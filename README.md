# Restaurant Page

This project was created as a project in the [JavaScript Path of The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page). In this project I practiced working with npm and webpack to bundle the project into a distinct dist folder.
The page is fully responsive for desktop and mobile views in Safari and Chrome browsers.
